# Constructing PHA-level characteristics üè†

## Description

For Simone Zhang and Rebecca A. Johnson, 2023, `Hierarchies in the Decentralized Welfare State: Prioritization in the Housing Choice Voucher Program,` <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224221147899" target="_blank">doi.org/10.1177/00031224221147899</a>

Code for acquiring and cleaning the external data sources used to describe PHAs and their local contexts. Analytic replication code is here: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/O3YYII

### Scripts to be run in order

- [00a_pulltract_shapefiles.R](https://github.com/rebeccajohnson88/hierarchies-hcv-externaldata/blob/main/src/00a_pulltract_shapefiles.R)

  - Takes in:
    - `data/raw/Estimated_Housing_Authority_Service_Areas`: shapefiles from HUD on PHA estimated service areas
  - What it does: uses the Census API/[tigris wrapper](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tigris/versions/1.6.1/topics/tracts) to pull the tract polygons in each state in which PHAs are located 
  - Outputs:
    - `data/intermediate/tracts_sf_format.RDS`: tract polygons stored in [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) format

- [00b_pha_tract_merge.R](https://github.com/rebeccajohnson88/hierarchies-hcv-externaldata/blob/main/src/00b_pha_tract_merge.R)

  - Takes in:
    - `data/intermediate/tracts_sf_format.RDS`
    - `data/raw/Estimated_Housing_Authority_Service_Areas`
  - What it does: restricts tract shapefiles and PHA shapefiles to polygons in same states
  - Outputs:
    - `data/intermediate/tracts_foroverlap.RDS`
    - `data/intermediate/phas_foroverlap.RDS`

- [01_spatialmerge_loopcode.R](https://github.com/rebeccajohnson88/hierarchies-hcv-externaldata/blob/main/src/01_spatialmerge_loopcode.R)

  - Takes in:
    - `data/intermediate/tracts_foroverlap.RDS`
    - `data/intermediate/phas_foroverlap.RDS`
  - What it does: iterates over state and finds the spatial intersection between the tract polygon and the PHA service area polygon; writes each state's output separately due to file sizes 
  - Outputs:
    - `data/intermediate/PHA_tract_bystate/[{State code}]_intersects.RDS`
    
- [02_pull_census_tractlevel.R](https://github.com/rebeccajohnson88/hierarchies-hcv-externaldata/blob/main/src/02_pull_census_tractlevel.R)
  - Takes in:
    - Spatial data from `data/intermediate/PHA_tract_bystate/[{State code}]_intersects.RDS`
    - `creds.yaml` file containing Census API key
  - What it does: specifies demographic variables to pull from the ACS 5-year estimates, uses the `get_ACS()` function in [tidycensus](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus/blob/master/man/get_acs.Rd) to pull tract-level counts, uses the ACS codebook to rename those estimated counts, and merges them back onto data at the PHA-tract dyad level (since one PHA can intersect with 1+ tracts)
  - Outputs:
    - `phas_wrawACScounts_longernames_20221216.RDS`: a PHA-tract dyad level dataset with counts of people in different demographic categories/raw values for attributes like median household income
